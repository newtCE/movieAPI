Collisions with solid objects/ships bigger than yourself are an instant kill as cited above.
Shess has a thin membrane of energy surrounding her ship when she charges so she has 2 overlapping hit boxes, one is static and goes out slightly further than her body, this hit box is energy damage only & it is possible to be hit by this hit box and not her body which will only inflict one level of damage vs. wrecking the ship. The hit box on the body of the mech is per pixel, so it is exactly the space that she takes up visually on the screen, at its widest it is smaller than the energy hit box and only ever gets more narrow as her tendrils spin.

It is a challenging fight no doubt but narrowing her hit box to be smaller would actually make it an even harder fight as in order to get any damage in on her horizontal charges you'd have to fly even more into the center of her mass which would make escaping damage from the energy hit box more difficult.

If she is hitting you with her body and not actually touching the ship, that is a totally different story and since seeing this post I've been double checking how close one can fly without getting hit to see if anything like that has happened and thus far I haven't been able to produce such an outcome.

We are in the midst of implementing feedback and if you can confirm such an event happening I'd like to be able to have it addressed in this next update, we're not trying to make anything unfair as we hate that kind of stuff and wanted to separate ourselves from most traditional shmups by not including things you could only possibly avoid through precognition.
